# ShoppingListv2
Second version of my shopping list app. 
Working on it as I'm learning android developement programming.
Changes made to this version:

- Switched to Android Studio from Eclipse

- Now data is saved between sessions even if the app is destroyed (duh)

- Edit button sometimes showed as disabled when app was resumed in some devices. Now it's corrected
