# ShoppingListv2
Second version of my shopping app. Working on it as I'm learning android developement programming

Switched to Android Studio from Eclipse

Now data is saved between sessions even if the app is destroyed (duh)

Edit button sometimes showed as disabled when app was resumed in some devices. Now it's corrected
